# This file was autogenerated by the 'packer hcl2_upgrade' command. We
# recommend double checking that everything is correct before going forward. We
# also recommend treating this file as disposable. The HCL2 blocks in this
# file can be moved to other files. For example, the variable blocks could be
# moved to their own 'variables.pkr.hcl' file, etc. Those files need to be
# suffixed with '.pkr.hcl' to be visible to Packer. To use multiple files at
# once they also need to be in the same folder. 'packer inspect folder/'
# will describe to you what is in that folder.

# Avoid mixing go templating calls ( for example ```{{ upper(`string`) }}``` )
# and HCL2 calls (for example '${ var.string_value_example }' ). They won't be
# executed together and the outcome will be unknown.

# All generated input variables will be of 'string' type as this is how Packer JSON
# views them; you can change their type later on. Read the variables type
# constraints documentation
# https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/hcl_templates/variables#type-constraints for more info.
